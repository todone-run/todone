# todone

> Never forget to follow up on your code's TODOs, maintain code quality, and pay back your technical debt.

Todone analyzes your code for `@TODO` comments linked to external references and alerts you when they are due.
For example, it can alert you when an GitHub issue is resolved, a Figma comment is marked as resolved, a browser features is well-supported, or a date has passed.

```tsx
const Logo = () => (
  // @TODO https://caniuse.com/webp
  // Use PNG images until we can use WebP ones.
  <img src="/log.png" alt="Logo" />
);

// @TODO date:2023-10-01
// Remove the deprecated function once six months have passed.
/** @deprecated */
export const deprecatedFoo = () => oldImplementation();

const Title = () => (
  /*
    @TODO https://www.figma.com/design/ABCDEFGHJ123124?node-id=193-21#1021383481
    The designer mentioned this color is too strong and should be changed.
  */
  <h1 style={{ color: "#f00" }}>Hello World</h1>
);

/*
  @TODO https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42
  Remove workaround once upstream issue is resolved.
*/
setTimeout(() => processQueue(), 0);
```

When any of the links are resolved, `todone` will alert you so you can take action. The tool is built on a plugin system, allowing you to extend its functionality with ways to check for more kinds of TODO comments.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install -D todone # if you use npm
$ yarn add -D todone    # if you use yarn
$ pnpm add -D todone    # if you use pnpm
```

## Usage

```
$ npx todone ./src

src/index.ts:1:5
        https://github.com/org/repo/issues/12
        EXPIRED
        expired on 5/13/2025

src/index.ts:3:5
        date:2026-06-21
        Not expired yet
        will expire on 6/21/2026


Analysis complete:
1 files found
2 matches found

1 expired results found
```

`todone run` (the default command) prints human-readable output; `--only-expired` hides results that haven't expired yet, `--locale` controls how dates are formatted, and `--unhandled-urls` controls what happens when no plugin handles a URL (`error`, the default, `warn`, or `ignore`). Use `todone run --json` instead to emit NDJSON (one JSON object per line) for machine consumption, or `todone run --check` to print nothing and exit with code 1 when any TODO is expired.

You can check more options by running `npx todone --help`.

## Configuration

Configure `todone` with a `todone.config.ts` (or `.js`) file in your project root:

```ts
import caniusePlugin from "@todone/plugin-caniuse";
import githubPlugin from "@todone/plugin-github";
import { defineConfig } from "todone/config";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [caniusePlugin(), githubPlugin()],
});
```

Other settings: `keyword` (default `"@TODO"`), `globs` (default `["**/*"]`), and `gitignore` (default `true`).

## Plugins

- {@link "@todone/plugin-caniuse"}
- {@link "@todone/plugin-date"}
- {@link "@todone/plugin-figma"}
- {@link "@todone/plugin-github"}

You can also write your own: a plugin is just a function returning an object with a `name` and a `checkMatch` hook that inspects a URL and returns a result, or `null` to decline it. Inside `checkMatch`, `this` provides `warn`, `info`, and `debug` for logging. See the `Plugin` type in `todone/plugin`.
